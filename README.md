# GPA-Calculator

Using BlueJ, I created a GPA Calculator that looks like this:

You can enter your grade (lowercase/uppercase is fine) as: A, B, C, D, and F. Note: If input isn't A-D, it is assumed that it's an F. When you enter your grade you also have to enter the amount of units that grade is attached to. 
For example: I would enter an 'A' and also a '4'. Then I would click add. 

Repeat this until desired. When finished you can click to find out your GPA. You'll see a result notification pop up and afterwards will be asked if you want to try again.
